The py5 library is similar to `Processing <https://processing.org/>`_ and `p5 <https://p5js.org/>`_ in that the basic functionality comes from user implemented ``settings``, ``setup``, and ``draw`` methods. These methods will initialize the Sketch parameters, run one-time setup code, and draw each frame of your animation.

In addition, py5 supports keyboard and mouse events with methods like ``mouse_clicked`` and ``key_pressed``.

All of this is analogous to what users familiar with `Processing <https://processing.org/>`_ and `p5 <https://p5js.org/>`_ might expect.

The py5 library has four "modes" that you can use to code these methods and write Sketches. They are called Module Mode, Class Mode, Imported Mode, and Static Mode.

  There are some known issues using py5 on Mac computers. The best option for Mac users is to use py5 through :doc:`jupyter-notebooks`, and after using the ``%gui osx`` magic. See :doc:`mac-users` for more information.

Module Mode
===========

Module Mode lets you write standalone ``settings``, ``setup``, and ``draw`` methods. Technically none are required but generally you will use both ``setup`` and ``draw``.

In Module Mode, you will access py5 functionality through module-level functions and fields.

Below is a simple example:

.. code:: python

    import py5

    def setup():
        py5.size(300, 200)
        py5.rect_mode(py5.CENTER)
        
    def draw():
        py5.rect(py5.mouse_x, py5.mouse_y, 10, 10)

    py5.run_sketch()

This will create a small Sketch that draws rectangles at the current mouse position.

Let's explain each part of the code.

The first statement imports the ``py5`` library in the same way that you would import any other Python library.

.. code:: python

    import py5

Next, the ``setup`` function. This function will be called one single time before beginning to repeatedly call the ``draw`` function for each frame of the animation. Typically the ``setup`` function is used to initialize variables or set py5 drawing options.

In this example the window size is set to be 300 pixels wide and 200 pixels tall. Almost always you'll begin a ``setup`` function similar to this one. Notice the call to the :doc:`size` function has a "``py5.``" prefix. All of the py5 methods and fields are module level attributes.

The call to :doc:`rect_mode` configures drawing options for future calls to py5's :doc:`rect` method. By default the first two coordinates specify the shape's upper left hand corner, but in this example they will specify the shape's center.

Folks who are familiar with Processing will note that the call to :doc:`size` is in the ``setup`` function, but technically it belongs in a ``settings`` function instead. Py5 allows the ``settings`` and ``setup`` functions to be combined, provided the rightful contents of ``settings`` appear before any of the real ``setup`` function code. There are rules about how combining ``settings`` and ``setup`` works; see :doc:`run_sketch` for more information. If for some reason you cannot meet the requirements for this functionality, you will need to write a separate ``settings`` function yourself.

.. code:: python

    def setup():
        py5.size(300, 200)
        py5.rect_mode(py5.CENTER)

If the ``draw`` function is not found, the Sketch will display a static image using draw commands found in the ``setup`` function. If the ``draw`` function is found, it will be repeatedly called once for each frame of an animation.

In this example, we draw one 10 by 10 pixel rectangle centered at the current mouse position. Accessing the module variables :doc:`mouse_x` and :doc:`mouse_y` will always provide the mouse's x and y coordinates.

.. code:: python

    def draw():
        py5.rect(py5.mouse_x, py5.mouse_y, 10, 10)

Finally, the call to :doc:`run_sketch`. This is will open a window and display your animation.

.. code:: python

    py5.run_sketch()

Note by default the call to :doc:`run_sketch` will not return until the Sketch exits, unless if it is running from a Jupyter Notebook or the IPython console. In that case it will return right away so the user can continue working in other cells in the notebook. Read the :doc:`run_sketch` documentation to learn more.

The design of Module Mode is modeled after matplotlib's pyplot.

.. caution::

    Do not use wildcard import syntax with the py5 library:

    .. code:: python

        from py5 import *

    Doing so would import usable methods, but the fields, such as ``mouse_x`` and ``mouse_y`` in the example above, would not work correctly. This is because py5's Module Mode is dependent on the module ``__getattr__`` and ``__dir__`` functionality described in `PEP 562 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0562/>`_.

    Wildcard imports also conflict with `Python best practices (PEP 8) <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#id23>`_ and in general should not be used.

    If you don't like prefixing everything with "``py5.``", use Imported Mode instead.

.. admonition:: Side Note

    Combining ``settings`` and ``setup`` functions requires py5 to have access to the function source code via Python's builtin ``inspect`` library. If you are running py5 code out of a Jupyter Notebook or a python souce file, it should work correctly. If you happen to be manually typing code into the generic Python REPL, it won't work.

.. admonition:: One More Side Note

    Much like you would do for a Processing Sketch, you may want to put supporting materials in a ``data`` subdirectory. A py5 Sketch will look for this relative to the current working directory. You can find out what the current working directory is and change it with Python's builtin``os`` library.

    .. code:: python

        >>> import os
        >>> os.chdir('/dir/that/contains/your/data/subdir')
        >>> print(os.getcwd())
        /dir/that/contains/your/data/subdir

    If that doesn't meet your needs, you can also set it explicitly when you call :doc:`run_sketch`.

    .. code:: python

        py5.run_sketch(py5_options=['--sketch-path=/dir/that/contains/your/data/subdir'])

Class Mode
==========

Class mode lets you create a class with its own ``settings``, ``setup``, and ``draw`` methods. The example above coded in Class Mode is as follows:

.. code:: python

    from py5 import Sketch


    class TestSketch(Sketch):

        def settings(self):
            self.size(300, 200)

        def setup(self):
            self.rect_mode(self.CENTER)

        def draw(self):
            self.rect(self.mouse_x, self.mouse_y, 10, 10)


    test = TestSketch()
    test.run_sketch()

Let us again explain each part of the code.

The first line imports the ``Sketch`` class, which will provide the py5 functionality.

.. code:: python

    from py5 import Sketch

Next, define a new class that inherits from ``Sketch``.

.. code:: python

    class TestSketch(Sketch):

Each of the ``settings``, ``setup``, and ``draw`` methods have a ``self`` parameter, just as they would in any Python class. The ``self`` parameter is used to access the ``py5`` methods and fields provided by the parent ``Sketch`` class. Observe that every occurance of the "``py5.``" prefix in the Module Mode example has been replaced with "``self.``".

Class Mode does not support combining ``settings`` and ``setup`` functions.

.. code:: python

        def settings(self):
            self.size(300, 200)

        def setup(self):
            self.rect_mode(self.CENTER)

        def draw(self):
            self.rect(self.mouse_x, self.mouse_y, 10, 10)

Finally, create an instance of the new class and call :doc:`run_sketch`.

.. code:: python

    test = TestSketch()
    test.run_sketch()

As before, the call to :doc:`run_sketch` will not return until the Sketch exits, unless if it is running from a Jupyter Notebook or the IPython console.

When developing in Jupyter Notebooks, Module Mode is the more convenient choice.

Class mode will let you run multiple Sketches at the same time. This cannot be done in Module Mode or Imported Mode.

.. caution::

    When learning to use py5, you may accidentally conflate Module Mode and Class Mode by writing code like this:

    .. code:: python

            def draw(self):
                self.rect(py5.mouse_x, py5.mouse_y, 10, 10)

    Do you see the mistake?

    The ``py5.mouse_x`` and ``py5.mouse_y`` code is suitable for Module Mode, so it is referencing the mouse position in a special default Sketch object found in the py5 module. However, in Class Mode you will create your own Sketch object, and as is being done here, call your Sketch object's ``rect`` method. This code is accidentally mixing one Sketch's methods with another's fields. This is most certainly not what is intended, and any error message will not properly explain what is wrong.

    This mistake will frequently be made when translating py5 code from one mode to another. I make this mistake all the time.

    A good way to avoid this is to import the library with only one of "``import py5``" or "``from py5 import Sketch``", depending on which mode you want to use. Importing both ways is asking for trouble.

Imported Mode
=============

Imported Mode was originally designed to be used by beginner programmers. It is analogous the Processing code users write in the Processing Development Editor (PDE). The Processing Editor does not currently support py5, but perhaps one day it will. Until then, you can use the py5 Jupyter Notebook Kernel or the ``run_sketch`` command line tool.

Below is our example Sketch written in Imported Mode:

.. code:: python

    def setup():
        size(300, 200)
        rect_mode(CENTER)
        
    def draw():
        rect(mouse_x, mouse_y, 10, 10)

    run_sketch()

Observe that any "``py5.``" and "``self.``" prefixes are removed. There are no "``import py5``" or "``from py5 import *``" statements.

To actually use this, make sure you have installed the py5 Jupyter Notebook Kernel, as described on the `Install py5 </install/#jupyter-notebook-kernel>`_ page. Then start Jupyter Lab using this command:

.. code:: bash

    $ jupyter lab

You will see the py5 kernel presented as an option in the Launcher. Click on it and put the code in a notebook cell.

The Python editor Thonny can be configured to work well with py5 in Imported Mode. See @tabreturn's detailed blog post `Portable Thonny and py5 <https://tabreturn.github.io/code/python/thonny/2021/06/21/thonny_and_py5.html>`_ for more information.

Imported Mode might be a good fit for the Jupyter Client `nteract <https://nteract.io/>`_ or the Python editor `Mu <https://codewith.mu/>`_.

The operation of Imported Mode should work just as well as analogous code written in the other py5 modes.

Static Mode
===========

Static Mode lets you create static images using functionless code. It is designed for beginner programmers who are making their first steps into Python programming.

The below Static Mode code will create a 300 by 200 pixel image with a gray background and 20 randomly positioned squares:

.. code:: python

    size(300, 200)
    rect_mode(CENTER)
    for _ in range(20):
        rect(random_int(width), random_int(height), 10, 10)

To use static mode, install py5bot as described on the `Install </install/#py5bot>`_ page. Then start Jupyter Lab using this command:

.. code:: bash

    $ jupyter lab

You will see the py5bot presented as an option in the Launcher. Click on it and put the code in a notebook cell.

You can also program in Static Mode using the ``run_sketch`` command line tool, or better yet, using Thonny. See @tabreturn's detailed blog post `Portable Thonny and py5 <https://tabreturn.github.io/code/python/thonny/2021/06/21/thonny_and_py5.html>`_ for information about how to set that up.
