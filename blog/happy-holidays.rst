Happy Holidays!

This is the 3D animation I made for my holiday cards using py5 and a new, soon-to-be-released version of `Camera3D <http://ixora.io/projects/camera-3D/>`_. You'll need `ChromaDepth <https://the3dmarket.com/collections/chromadepth>`_ glasses to see the 3D effect properly.

Music: `This is Christmas <https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Scott_Holmes/christmas-background-music/this-is-christmas>`_ by `Scott Holmes Music <https://freemusicarchive.org/music/Scott_Holmes>`_.

The snowflakes are from the old and widely used `WWFlakes <https://www.fontspace.com/wwflakes-font-f3391>`_ font by `WindWalker64 <https://www.fontspace.com/windwalker64>`_.

The `actual source code for this animation is available on github as a gist <https://gist.github.com/hx2A/1b717cf958932a97a06a860d83c2fd85>`_. This is a good example of how one can easily augment py5 with a Java Processing library. 

This animation took some time to create because I first had to figure out how to implement ChromaDepth in Java. It's also the first time I did something notable in Processing using shaders, and that took some effort to learn. Shaders are a topic I've been wanting to explore for a long time and am happy I got the opportunity to do so while creating this. I'm also happy that py5 performed well during the development process. I didn't have to fix any bugs. Hooray!
