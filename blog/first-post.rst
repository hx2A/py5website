This is my first post to the py5 blog. The purpose of this blog is to document my progress developing the library. This includes the technical aspects of the library, such as the release schedule, and non-technical aspects such as documentation and community growth.

In addition, as the py5 community grows, I will post links to notable py5 projects. I'd like to highlight everything from student work to the work of professional artists to commercial applications. I do believe in the usefulness of py5 and I'm so excited for the creative community to start using it.
