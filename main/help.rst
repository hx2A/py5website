Right now the most important thing I need is for a few people to try py5 and provide feedback.

I'll also need help debugging and fixing OS specific bugs. I do all of my development work on Linux. I don't have a Mac computer available, so I can't test or debug on those machines. I do have a Windows machine and have done limited testing on it, but I find Windows to be an unpleasant platform to code on and try to avoid it as much as possible.

In time I'll update this page as this project's needs evolve.
