Right now the most important thing I need is for people to try py5 and provide feedback.

It would also be great if someone was willing to help write tutorials and example code. Right now that area of the documentation is seriously lacking.

I could also use help with the Windows and OSX specific GUI problems listed on Github. In particular, the :doc:`mac-users` describes numerous problems with Mac computers. I do all of my development work on Linux and know very little about platform specific GUI programming. All of the bugs I'd like help with are listed on Github with the `help wanted <https://github.com/hx2A/py5generator/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22>`_ tag.

In time I'll update this page as this project's needs evolve.
