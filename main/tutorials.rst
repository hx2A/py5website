Before you start reading the tutorials, I want to be upfront with you and say that the documentation here is poor. Sorry about that.

The documentation is very much a work in progress, and I've been struggling with writers block for a while. But then I realized that the goal of writing great documentation was keeping me from writing anything at all, and as the saying goes, don't let perfect get in the way of the mediocre. Or something like that. So what I am doing now is I'm trying to get information out of my head into...something, even if that something seems more like a brain dump. The truth is I need help writing the documentation and organizing this properly, but nobody can provide helpful feedback until I at least get something out of my head so at least a few people can get started using this. And once I get everything out, I'll move from mediocre to adequate, and from there, perhaps great documentation. In time I'll get there. Please be patient with me.
