Adds a directional light.

Description
===========

Adds a directional light. Directional light comes from one direction: it is stronger when hitting a surface squarely, and weaker if it hits at a gentle angle. After hitting a surface, directional light scatters in all directions. Lights need to be included in the ``draw()`` to remain persistent in a looping program. Placing them in the ``setup()`` of a looping program will cause them to only have an effect the first time through the loop. The ``v1``, ``v2``, and ``v3`` parameters are interpreted as either ``RGB`` or ``HSB`` values, depending on the current color mode. The ``nx``, ``ny``, and ``nz`` parameters specify the direction the light is facing. For example, setting ``ny`` to -1 will cause the geometry to be lit from below (since the light would be facing directly upward).

This method is the same as :doc:`directional_light` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`directional_light`.

Underlying Java method: PGraphics.directionalLight

Syntax
======

.. code:: python

    directional_light(v1: float, v2: float, v3: float, nx: float, ny: float, nz: float, /) -> None

Parameters
==========

* **nx**: `float` - direction along the x-axis
* **ny**: `float` - direction along the y-axis
* **nz**: `float` - direction along the z-axis
* **v1**: `float` - red or hue value (depending on current color mode)
* **v2**: `float` - green or saturation value (depending on current color mode)
* **v3**: `float` - blue or brightness value (depending on current color mode)
