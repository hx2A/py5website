Description
===========

Loads the pixel data of the current Py5Graphics drawing surface into the :doc:`py5graphics_np_pixels` array. This method must always be called before reading from or writing to :doc:`py5graphics_np_pixels`. It should only be used between calls to :doc:`py5graphics_begin_draw` and :doc:`py5graphics_end_draw`. Subsequent changes to the Py5Graphics drawing surface will not be reflected in :doc:`py5graphics_np_pixels` until ``load_np_pixels()`` is called again.

The ``load_np_pixels()`` method is similar to :doc:`py5graphics_load_pixels` in that ``load_np_pixels()`` must be called before reading from or writing to :doc:`py5graphics_np_pixels` just as :doc:`py5graphics_load_pixels` must be called before reading from or writing to :doc:`py5graphics_pixels`.

Note that ``load_np_pixels()`` will as a side effect call :doc:`py5graphics_load_pixels`, so if your code needs to read :doc:`py5graphics_np_pixels` and :doc:`py5graphics_pixels` simultaneously, there is no need for a separate call to :doc:`py5graphics_load_pixels`. However, be aware that modifying both :doc:`py5graphics_np_pixels` and :doc:`py5graphics_pixels` simultaneously will likely result in the updates to :doc:`py5graphics_pixels` being discarded.

This method is the same as :doc:`load_np_pixels` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object.

Syntax
======

.. code:: python

    load_np_pixels() -> None
