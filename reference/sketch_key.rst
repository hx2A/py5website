Description
===========

The system variable ``key`` always contains the value of the most recent key on the keyboard that was used (either pressed or released). 
 
For non-ASCII keys, use the :doc:`key_code` variable. The keys included in the ASCII specification (``BACKSPACE``, ``TAB``, ``ENTER``, ``RETURN``, ``ESC``, and ``DELETE``) do not require checking to see if the key is coded, and you should simply use the ``key`` variable instead of :doc:`key_code`. If you're making cross-platform projects, note that the ``ENTER`` key is commonly used on PCs and Unix and the ``RETURN`` key is used instead on Macintosh. Check for both ``ENTER`` and ``RETURN`` to make sure your program will work for all platforms.

There are issues with how :doc:`key_code` behaves across different renderers and operating systems. Watch out for unexpected behavior as you switch renderers and operating systems.
