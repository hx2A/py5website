Quits/stops/exits the program.

Examples
========

.. raw:: html

    <div class="example-table">

.. raw:: html

    <div class="example-row"><div class="example-cell-image">

.. raw:: html

    </div><div class="example-cell-code">

.. code:: python
    :number-lines:

    def draw():
        py5.line(py5.mouse_x, py5.mouse_y, 50, 50)


    def mouse_pressed():
        exit()

.. raw:: html

    </div></div>

.. raw:: html

    </div>

Description
===========

Quits/stops/exits the program. Programs without a ``draw()`` function stop automatically after the last line has run, but programs with ``draw()`` run continuously until the program is manually stopped or ``exit_sketch()`` is run.

Rather than terminating immediately, ``exit_sketch()`` will cause the sketch to exit after ``draw()`` has completed (or after ``setup()`` completes if called during the ``setup()`` function).

For Python programmers, this is *not* the same as ``sys.exit()``. Further, ``sys.exit()`` should not be used because closing out an application while ``draw()`` is running may cause a crash (particularly with P3D).

Underlying Java method: `exit <https://processing.org/reference/exit_.html>`_

Syntax
======

.. code:: python

    exit_sketch() -> None
