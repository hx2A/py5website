Sets the current alignment for drawing text.

Description
===========

Sets the current alignment for drawing text. The parameters ``LEFT``, ``CENTER``, and ``RIGHT`` set the display characteristics of the letters in relation to the values for the ``x`` and ``y`` parameters of the :doc:`py5graphics_text` function.
 
An optional second parameter can be used to vertically align the text. ``BASELINE`` is the default, and the vertical alignment will be reset to ``BASELINE`` if the second parameter is not used. The ``TOP`` and ``CENTER`` parameters are straightforward. The ``BOTTOM`` parameter offsets the line based on the current :doc:`py5graphics_text_descent`. For multiple lines, the final line will be aligned to the bottom, with the previous lines appearing above it.
 
When using :doc:`py5graphics_text` with width and height parameters, ``BASELINE`` is ignored, and treated as ``TOP``. (Otherwise, text would by default draw outside the box, since ``BASELINE`` is the default setting. ``BASELINE`` is not a useful drawing mode for text drawn in a rectangle.)
 
The vertical alignment is based on the value of :doc:`py5graphics_text_ascent`, which many fonts do not specify correctly. It may be necessary to use a hack and offset by a few pixels by hand so that the offset looks correct. To do this as less of a hack, use some percentage of :doc:`py5graphics_text_ascent` or :doc:`py5graphics_text_descent` so that the hack works even if you change the size of the font.

This method is the same as :doc:`text_align` but linked to a ``Py5Graphics`` object. To see example code for how it can be used, see :doc:`text_align`.

Underlying Java method: PGraphics.textAlign

Syntax
======

.. code:: python

    text_align(align_x: int, /) -> None
    text_align(align_x: int, align_y: int, /) -> None

Parameters
==========

* **align_x**: `int` - horizontal alignment, either LEFT, CENTER, or RIGHT
* **align_y**: `int` - vertical alignment, either TOP, BOTTOM, CENTER, or BASELINE
